# ClientSever
This project was developed to introduce the client server technology and its application in conjunction with WebAPI (ASP.NET Minimal API) and WPF (MVVM).

Server WebAPI(MinAPI) Includes technologies such as:
.NET 7.0,
EntityFramework core,
MSSQL relational database(CRUD,VIEW),
LINQ.

WPF client Includes technologies and patterns such as:
.NET 7.0,
MVVM,
HTTP Sockets,
LINQ.

All the given code does not make any deep sense, but only shows the connection between the Client (WPF Application) and the Server (MinAPI) and is strictly of an educational nature.
